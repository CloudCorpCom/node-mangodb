MangoDB is one of the fastest databases in existence. It allows you to store ANY KIND OF DATA you want without any IO
bottleneck. You're only limited by the size of your pipe.

If you're familiar with MongoDB then you'll feel right at home with Mango. We'll instantly map all of your existing
data without ANY EFFORT with a new and improved AUTO SHARTING ALGORITHM.

#Getting Started

Install dependancies

```
make install
```

Run the server

```
make run_server
```

With your MongoDB client, connect to ``localhost`` on port ``27017``.

That's it! You'll enjoy the same reliability as you're used to with MongoDB, but you'll get your responses so fast
that you'll never want to go back!

#MangoDB and the Cloud


The cloud can be a scary place to put your database. However, thanks to Mango's proprietary auto sharting algorithm
you won't need to worry, since Mango supports immediate autoscaling without any pesky configuration or having to
wait for your cluster to rebalance -- just start a new Mango node and you can scale to infinity!

Also, due to MangoDB's innovative design, your database is no longer affected by your infrastructure provider's
problems like slow or inaccessible block storage devices. While everyone else's databases are crashing and timing out,
Mango will keep flying along as normal. It's an operations engineer's dream!
